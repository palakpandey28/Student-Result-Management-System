-------------- PROJECT TITLE --------------- 


      * Student Result Management System *


 --------------- Problem statement---------------


 In many schools and colleges, teachers still calculate student results manually, which often leads to errors in total marks, averages, and grades. This process becomes slow and inefficient when handling multiple students. There is a need for a simple system that can automatically process marks and generate accurate results.

The Student Result Management System solves this problem by providing a basic Java console-based program that takes student details and subject marks, calculates totals and averages automatically, assigns grades, and displays the result clearly. It also helps identify the topper among all students. This makes result processing faster, error-free, and more organized.


----------------Scope of the project-----------------

The scope of this project is to create a simple, console-based Java application that helps manage and generate student results. The system focuses on taking student details, recording marks, processing results, and displaying them in a clear format.

What the system includes:

1. Student Data Input
      Allows entering student name, roll number, class, and subject marks.

2.Automatic Calculations
     Calculates total marks, average marks, and grade based on the input.

3. Sorting Results
     Sorts all students by total marks to show highest to lowest.

4. Finding the Topper
    Identifies and displays the student with the highest total marks.

Displaying Results
    Shows all student results in a structured tabular format.

What the system does NOT include:

1. No database or file storage (data is processed only during runtime).

2. No login system, admin roles, or authentication.

3. No GUI or web interface — only console-based.

4. No advanced report export features (PDF/Excel/etc.).


----------------Target users-------------------

This Student Result Management System is designed for the following users:

1. Teachers / Faculty

    a.They enter student details and marks.

    b. They generate results, view topper lists, and check sorted results.

    c.They are the primary users of the system.

2. Students

     a.They can view their results (when displayed by the teacher).

     b.They do not have permission to update or edit any data.

3. Exam Department / Academic Staff

     a. They can use the system to quickly compile results for a class.

     b.Helpful for preparing reports, comparing performance, and identifying toppers.


------------------High-level features---------------------

This Student Result Management System provides the following major features:

1. Student Information Handling

   a. Allows entering basic student details such as name, roll number, and class.

   b.Stores marks for multiple subjects.

2. Automatic Result Processing

    a. Calculates total marks, average marks, and grade instantly.

    b.Ensures accuracy by automating the entire calculation process.

3. Sorting of Results

     a. Sorts all students based on total marks (highest to lowest).

     b. Helps in analyzing performance quickly.

4. Topper Identification

   a. Automatically identifies the student with the highest total marks.

   b. Displays topper details separately.

5. Clean Result Display

   a. Shows all results in a formatted table.

   b.Includes subject-wise marks, total, average, and grade for each student.
